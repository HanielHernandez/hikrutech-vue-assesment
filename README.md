# vue-assessment

This a Vue 3 assessment for [Hikru](https://www.hikrutech.com/), showcasing a modern and scalable approach to building a job listing platform. The application is built using Vue 3 and its ecosystem, with reusable components structured following the Atomic Design methodology. Each component was documented using Storybook, promoting clarity and maintainability. State management is handled via Pinia, while Vue Router enables seamless navigation with lazy-loaded routes for optimal performance. Mock job data is dynamically fetched and filtered from a local JSON file, with built-in pagination and search to enhance usability. Styling is managed with TailwindCSS for a clean and responsive UI. The project also leverages TypeScript for type safety and Vitest for unit testing, ensuring code quality, performance, and a streamlined developer experience.
